Welcome to your new l7mp ingress gateway reference deployment. 

The deployment consists of a set of l7mp proxies configured to be run
as ingress gateways and an l7mp operator acting as a control plane for
the ingress gateways. Here is the short summary of the next steps to
make use of your new l7mp service mesh.

1. To get a simple dashboard showing the overall summary of the
   system:

   watch "kubectl get pod,svc,vsvc,target,rule -o wide -n {{.Release.Namespace }} --show-labels"

2. Check that that the l7mp control plane was successfully initialized
   by verifying the status of the l7mp-operator deployment and service
   in the default namespace. Furthermore, check that the l7mp ingress
   gateways are also operational by checking the status if the
   l7mp-ingress daemonset.
